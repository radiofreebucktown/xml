   <bio><![CDATA[Cooper Moore is a singer/songwriter/producer from Chicago, Illinois. Emerging on the scene from a young age, Cooper's take on indie rock is immediately recognized. With a grunge grit, alt-country twang, folk sensibilities, pop arrangements, and a taste for electronica, he creates with a vulnerable confidence in his tastes & idiosyncrasies. Cooper's debut The Long Run EP, released in June, places his lyrics and knack for melody at the forefront. Toeing the lines between irony and earnestness, humor and sincerity, The Long Run is a voice instantly recognized as authentic. Moore, now based in New York City, continues to grow as a songwriter, producer, performer, and world builder. With a slate of shows across the country in the spring, he is gearing up to release his debut LP in the summer of 2026. Cooper Moore's full-length debut is a collection of memories & discoveries that view experience as a forager views a forest. The record, exhibiting an awe for life, nature, and imperfection, follows the same distinguishing ethos as his past works. ]]></bio>
